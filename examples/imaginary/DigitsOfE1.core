-- Compute the digits of "e" using continued fractions.
-- Original program due to Dale Thurston, Aug 2001

-- Compute the decimal representation of e progressively.
-- 
-- A continued fraction expansion for e is
-- 
-- [2,1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,1,...]

eContFrac = 2:aux 2 where aux n = 1:n:1:aux (n+2)

-- We need a general function that applies an arbitrary linear fractional
-- transformation to a legal continued fraction, represented as a list of
-- positive integers.  The complicated guard is to see if we can output a
-- digit regardless of what the input is; i.e., to see if the interval
-- [1,infinity) is mapped into [k,k+1) for some k.

-- ratTrans (a,b,c,d) x: compute (a + bx)/(c+dx) as a continued fraction 
-- Output a digit if we can
ratTrans (a,b,c,d) xs
 = if ((signum'Int c `eq'Int` signum'Int d) || (abs'Int c`lt'Int`abs'Int d)) && -- No pole in range
      (c+d)*q `lte'Int` a+b && (c+d)*q `add'Int` (c+d) `gt'Int` a+b        -- Next digit is determined
    then q:ratTrans (c,d,a-q*c,b-q*d) xs
    else case xs of (x:xs) -> ratTrans (b,a+x*b,d,c+x*d) xs
  where q = b `div'Int` d

--Finally, we convert a continued fraction to digits by repeatedly multiplying by 10.

toDigits xs = case xs of (x:xs) -> x:toDigits (ratTrans (10,0,0,1) xs)
